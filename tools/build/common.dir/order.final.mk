# Makefile to define the order of all the 'passes':
#    * 'GEN' where files are generated.
#    		1. initfiles are transformed into .C/.H/.mk files
#    		2. ec specific ring generation wrapper .C/.mk files
#    		   are generated.
#    	    3. ec specific cmsk wrapper .C/.mk files are generated
#
#    * 'MODULE' where modules are built.
#    		1. hwp procedure code and files generaged in the
#    		   GEN phase are compiled into libraries (.a/.so)
#
#    * 'EXE' where executables are built.
#    		1. procedure wrappers are compiled into exe files.
#    		2. ring generation wrappers are compiled into exe files
#    		3. ring .bin.srd files are generated
#    		4. cmsk procedure .C/.H/.mk files are created by
#    		   create_stumped_ring.exe
#
#    * 'PRE_IMAGE' where cmsk rings are built.
#    		1. cmsk ring wrappers are compiled and
#    		   executed to generate cmsk rings
#
#    * 'IMAGE' where images are built.
#    		1. .rings section is created
#    		2. .overlays seciton is created
#    		3. ppe sub images are compiled and assembled into
#    		   xip sections
#    		4. hw images are created
#    * 'ALL' for everything else, like documentation.
