Power Management Fapi2-PPE platform implementation notes

0) Memo for addressing powman ppe plat implementation of fapi2 concerns

Conclusion first:
VERY VERY VERY MUCH depends on whether architecture makes sense for doing platform support of powman ppe

It was attempted briefly on p9 project, here is its historical limits and reasons:
a) Multicast with ex abomination caused support of multicast going left and right with extra cost
b) Sbe plat code was borrowed and hacked, which had getEffectiveAddress() called on each scom.
The function is necessary for sbe to address various targeting and address overlay situations.
If it is being inlined, then code blows up, or if it is called as function, 
still cost on being efficient scom, as handling error return code on each scom. 

This time for p10 project, quad chiplet layout and qme addressing are simplied as number of 
chiplets and targets and address overlay that it has to process are far less and straightforard
compare to p9; thus it does make sense to be possible to implement efficient code.

Moreoever, borrowing sbe plat code is never going to meet powman ppe plat requirement, this time
having this implemented from scratch provided code can be as good as conventional c implementation.

So the conclusion or suggestion for future project is this: first whether architecture makes sense,
as core+cache units v.s. cme/qme v.s. perv chiplets layout makes targeting a very complex case 
as well as multicast group and addressing are made convenience for ppe plat to utilize via fapi2.

Second, it would cost resources to implement the plat code from scratch or modify from 
my current methods based on real need of qme/cme plat of targeting from given project. 
It wont work just copy old code over, even from this code of mine for p11. Again, because it is 
very architecture dependant requiring customization as well as optimization based on 
the advantage and disadvantage of whatever architecture as well.

Btw, it would be very similar situation that if a gpe i.e. sgpe if asked to support fapi2 to 
what sbe would arrive at plat implementation; however full customization is still advised as the 
disadvantage of sbe platform will still likely to be obstacle for gpe support to address.

In my vision, only support the targets that really is needed is the key, and design 
plat_handle accordingly. Never support the same numbers of targets that sbe had to, which will
result similar inefficiency that you are forced into. Another reason for not just copying 
code over or try to modify slightly to get a pass(I tried the first time but failed miserablely) 
but design thoughtfully respectively based on architecture and fapi2 code at the time.


1) Plat files are originally copied from <ekb root>/hwpf/fapi2/include/plat and <ekb root>/hwpf/fapi2/src/plat
This implementation will avoid changing any fapi2 base files in <ekb root>/hwpf/fapi2/include and 
<ekb root>/hwpf/fapi2/src. The former will be included as it is by plat code, the latter is not compiled.
Therefore, those fapi2 files are not copied and the original fapi2/plat directory structure isnt followed. 
Moreover, the filenames arent changed and shouldnt be changed for easy reference to orginal plat files.


2) There are really only these functions that actually need support:
a) <plan_target.H> --> define iv_handle struct/class, included by fapi2_target.H
   <target.H>      --> implement class functions declared in fapi2_target.H
   <target.C>      --> plat code to init and interface with targets
b) <hw_access.H> getScom, putScom --> <plat_hw_access.H> --> ppe inline load/store macros 
   <hw_access.H> putRing --> plat_ring_traverse.C/H --> plat_ring_untils.C/H
c) <plat_utils.C> delay --> ppe apis to count timebase
d) <plat_trace.H> FAPI_INF/DBG/ERR --> PK_TRACE_INF/DBG/ERR
e) <plat_error_scope.H> FAPI_TRY --> no-op
f) pool.C/H and assert.h are supporting utilities that you cannot miss, unless no usage of vectors
g) there are files you need to create to satisfy fapi2 base includes but no need to implement anything


3) FAPI_EXEC_HWP isnt supported by this plat, its plat files are deleted, because two reasons:
a) It is pretty much the same as how FAPI_TRY does things, which we bypass to speed up scoms
b) User needs to create RC to use the macro, however, ppe code isnt designed to pass RC also due to speed/size.
Btw, the deleted files are plat_subroutine_executor.H, plat_hwp_executor.H remained for meeting fapi2 includes 
Also, plat_target_filter file is also deleted, because we are not support getChildren via filter
Moreoever, spd/vpd/mmio/i2c_access files are also deleted as plat doesnt have need to support at all.
only hw_access is supported to handle all ppe plat IOs.
Note the above deleted files can be absent because there is no base fapi2 includes them by default.


4) putRing files
hw_access.H.putRing --> plat_ring_traverse.C/H.findRS4InImageAndApply --> plat_ring.utils.C/H.*
includes plat_ring_ids.H


5) Attribute and Error XML Parse Support:

ppe/tools/platXML/ppeParseAttributeInfo.pl generates:
attribute_ids.H         
fapi2_chip_ec_feature.H 

ppe/tools/platXML/ppeCreateAttrGetSetMacros.pl modifies:
plat_attribute_service.H 

ppe/tools/platXML/parseErrorInfo.pl generates:
hwp_ffdc_classes.H       
hwp_error_info.H
hwp_return_codes.H

non-fapi2 files to create image data section where attributes are stored:
ppe/tools/platXML/ppeParseAttributeStruct.pl generates
ppe_attribute_struct.H   
which includes:
ppe_attribute_macro.H
ppe_attribute_const.H


6) Special comments used
a) //PLAT NOTE// comments added to explain why or how plat code is implemented
b) //PLAT EXTRA// and //PLAT END// are used to indicate the code section, 
which is completely newly added as from the original files. However, 
single case of already declared function implementation isnt indicated, but inline implemented


7) Certain functions, that are declared in base fapi2 class or as prototypes in generic fapi2 headers,
are not going to be supported on ppe platform, like ever. Previous methods to handle are the following two:

A) Use __PPE__ compiler flag to compile out the pseduo plat implementation by native fapi2.
This method creates several long skip-build block in the source,
that is hard to keep tracking which functions are supported while reading the source,
also makes it difficult to change one function back to be supported(more local compile flags to be created),
and seriously, this is __PPE__ platform code created separately from other platform code, 
so there is no way ifndef __PPE__ is ever going to be true. So may as well delete the code instead of flag

B) Actually implement the function, but use static_assert to generate error for non-supported.
this is ok but seriously, why bother to implement never supported functions just to print an error message.
Again, If I delete the code block and user accidently called it, it will also cause build fail.

I decided to go with the approach that uses special comment mark "//F2//" to comment out every line 
from native pseduo fapi2 plat implementation that is not supported on these powman ppe platform code. 

The advantage of this is whoever read the source can obvious see what is actually used by the code.
Also not to mix-use option A and B together as effort wasted and unclean maintainance
They are not simply deleted for two reasons: 
i)  quick adding support in the future should it ever needs, as from using compiler flag from option A
ii) easy for reader to compare with original fapi2 files side-by-side to track any late changes to fapi2

By doing this, user will also find out by failing the build right away if 
non-supported function is used in user code. Otherwise, linker will never try to track down any 
declared but not defined function if it is never used.
